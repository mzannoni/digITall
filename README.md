# digITall

Simple VHDL example, which I'm using to refresh my familiarity with digital design and to learn [GHDL](https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl).

## Getting started

A first [text-bench](./tb_main.vhdl) for a simple [sequence cycler](./blind_cycler.vhdl) can be run following the basics steps noted down [here](./command_notes.md).

## TODO:
- [ ] create a proper script (e.g. based on [command notes](./command_notes.md)).
